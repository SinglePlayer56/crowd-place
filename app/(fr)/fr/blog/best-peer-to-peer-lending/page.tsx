                                Thanks to the peer-to-peer lending sector (the P2P sector), it is possible for individuals
                                and businesses to lend to each other through a platform. Today's modern era brings new
                                opportunities, that investors and borrowers can benefit from. Both parties can benefit from
                                this new way of financing, while a P2P lending platform operates as an intermediary, thereby
                                giving both parties security.

                                The P2P platforms bring supply and demand into contact and also manage the P2P loans. This

                                Thanks to regulations, P2P lending is legal in the UK. Operating a P2P lending platform is
                                an activity regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the regulator in this area
                                in the UK. Operating electronic systems where lending activities are carried out are listed
                                in section 6B of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. This states that lenders must
                                be an individual and the lending platform must have approval from the FCA. Once this
                                approval is obtained, the lending platform and the lender may conduct the relevant
                                activities.

                                this huge return on every platform on an annual basis because P2P lending platforms have

                                Our research has shown that Loanpad is the best peer-to-peer lending UK. This makes lending
                                through this platform among investments that are relatively safe. Whatever asset class you
                                will lend in, <i>with Loanpad, you will receive a return of 5.6%.</i> This platform is also
                                extremely suitable for investors who want to start P2P lending, as <i>you can start from as
                                little as Â£10.</i> An additional advantage of Loanpad is that you can automatically lend
                                money
                                to all outstanding borrowers in a loan portfolio. This way you can spread the risk, which
                                gives extra security.

                                After experimenting with it, Loanpad proved to have several advantages over competitors. For
                                example, Loanpad does not use the expected sales value of property unless the development is
                                already 75% complete. In this case, these development loans are made for less than half the
                                expected sales price. Another advantage is that lenders on Loanpad get the loans and
                                interest paid first, before other parties who lent money are paid.
                            </PTag>

                                Parties who lend usually raise the money before they need it, so that a sudden disaster will
                                not hinder the development process. As a result, pandemics or building crises, for example,
                                cannot affect the process, so downtime need not be a danger to lenders on the P2P platform.
                                Our analysis of this P2P platform showed that all loans on Loanpad have been successfully
                                repaid or are expected to do so.

                                Based on our observations, AxiaFunder is the most attractive P2P platform based on annual
                                returns. <i>Returns of 25% or more are very achievable</i> and few investments can exceed
                                these
                                percentages. Most P2P lending platforms are focused on real estate, but through AxiaFunder
                                you fund lawsuits. This way of lending money can be very lucrative, but when a lawsuit is
                                lost you can also lose a lot of money. In short, this form of lending money is slightly
                                riskier, but so are the returns.

                                only one case has been lost, with lenders losing a quarter of their investment. However, the
                                other <i>successful cases have very high returns, ranging between 23% and 71%.</i> If you
                                want to
                                invest in different sectors, lending through AxiaFunder can help you diversify. AxiaFunder
                                focuses on sophisticated and professional investors, so this P2P lending platform is not

                                P2P lending platforms with the highest lending rates in the UK, but this also means that the
                                risk level can be relatively high.

                                Our data shows that Invest & Fund has the best record of repaying development loans on time.

                                through this P2P lending platform. <i>You can earn these percentages just by putting in a
                                minimum of Â£2500 and you can spread this amount over 10 loans.</i> This allows you to spread
                                your risk across several lending products, but this is not the only security Invest & Fund
                                gives to lenders. Our analysis of Invest & Fund showed that over Â£200 million in loans have
                                been issued on the platform in the past seven years.

                                Of this huge amount of loans, only two have repaid after their expected end date, but even
                                these loans have been repaid in full. Invest & Fund's P2P loans are almost always senior,
                                meaning that lenders are always paid back first. It is also possible to contribute to junior
                                loans, but these are present to a lesser extent on this platform. Junior loans are not
                                easily approved by Invest & Fund, but do provide more return for lenders. In total, you can
                                earn 15% to 25% returns with junior loans, which is due to the extra high risk.

                                As the name implies, Proplend is a P2P lending platform that focuses on property mortgages.
                                <i>Investing in this form of loan as a lender means that you can earn 5% to 7% annual
                                    returns.</i>
                                This return is made by the rental income generated by the property. The properties used for
                                this purpose are worth at least twice as much as the loan itself. This minimizes the risks
                                involved in lending money. In addition to these loans, on the Proplend platform you can also
                                choose riskier loans, which have an average return of 8%.

                                Our analysis of this platform shows that <i>you can start lending as little as Â£1,000 on
                                Proplend.</i> The convenient thing about this P2P lending platform is that you can choose
                                loans
                                yourself, but also have the option to automatically lend in low-risk loans. This makes
                                Proplend a very flexible platform that is a suitable choice for a variety of investors.

                                Our research has shown that Proplend is a very reliable platform in terms of payments. In
                                the past 8 years, there has been only one loan that was not profitable. Most P2P lending
                                companies in the UK focus on development loans, but Proplend takes a different approach. By
                                focusing mainly on loans to landlords, against properties that are already rented out, the
                                risk is reduced and this gives you more protection as a lender.

                                Via Assetz Exchange, it is possible to offer loans and also to sell loans at a profit. Most
                                P2P lending platforms in the UK offer loans for property, but Assetz Exchange takes a
                                different approach. The lending platform lends to separate companies set up by the lending
                                platform itself. These companies act as landlords and rent their properties to charities and
                                housing associations, for example. These tenants make their money from subletting and
                                contributions from local governments, thereby reducing the risk.

                                As a result, this P2P lending platform is suitable for a variety of investors. This P2P
                                lending strategy can also be very beneficial. <i>Our analysis of this platform showed that
                                lenders make an average annual return of about 6%.</i> If you are looking to diversify when
                                increasing your wealth, lending to different sectors can be a useful move. This sector is a
                                lot less risky, which makes lending through Assetz Exchange very attractive.

                                noticed that you can get started very quickly. The online application process on
                                Lendermarket takes less than 10 minutes, so you can get started quickly. The starting amount
                                is also very low at this lending company, as <i>you can get started and lend money as low as

                                Lendermarket buys the loan from the lenders, so they have no financial uncertainty. A unique

                                Another P2P lending platform in the UK is CrowdProperty, a lending company that focuses on
                                development loans. <i>This platform is suitable for a variety of investors in that you can
                                start from as little as Â£500 per loan.</i> In addition, it is possible to use auto-lending,

                                CrowdProperty is around 7.64%.</i> Based on our own experience, this is a wonderful return
                                for a
                                less risky loan. The lending platform's records confirm this once again, as all loans have
                                been repaid in full.

                                Also at CrowdProperty, lenders are the senior lenders, who will be the first to receive all
                                loans and interest. Other parties who have lent money to the same borrower only receive the
                                lent money and interest after that. The British P2P lending platform has grown significantly
                                in recent years and even received an additional source of funding in 2021, amounting to Â£300
                                million. This financial boost adds to the platform's reliability.

                                highest P2P loan returns can be as high as 71%. However, <i>it is essential to consider that
                                higher returns often come with higher risks.</i> After thorough research, eight P2P lending
                                platforms have been identified as the best in the UK, and all of these lending platforms
                                have different rates of return.

                                The top 8 is not the perfect ranking for every investor. Each individual investor differs
                                from the order and this is due to their desired investment strategy. The P2P lending
                                platforms that offer lower returns can therefore be very interesting for some lenders
                                because the risk is a lot lower. <i>The P2P lending industry in the UK has a wide range of
                                opportunities for both investors and borrowers.</i> By doing thorough research and choosing the

                                potentially high returns and flexibility offered by P2P lending platforms.
